# Muscle-Sensor-ML-for-Hand-Prosthetic

For the final project in CS 440: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence offered by Colorado State University, I have decided to do a project on using a Electromyogram (EMG) and Machine Learning to control a robotic hand. An EMG records the intensity of a muscle flex in voltage units. The more flex, the higher the reading is. I used a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify whether I am making a fist (intense flex) or not (no flex) based on the EMG readings.
